Press Release

To restore the share capital after the proposed reduction of the share capital set out in a) above, the

Board of Directors proposes that the AGM simultaneously resolves to increase the share capital

through bonus issue, by transferring the same amount from the Company’s unrestricted equity. The

bonus issue is carried out without the issuance of new shares.

The Board of Directors’ proposal in accordance with item A) – B) above shall be resolved upon as

one resolution by the AGM.

The Board of Directors, the CEO or the person appointed by the Board of Directors may make such

minor adjustments to the resolution of the AGM as are required for its registration with the Swedish

Companies Registration Office or due to other formal requirements.

For a valid decision of the AGM in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal above it is

required that the decision is approved by shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of the

casted votes as well as of the shares represented at the AGM.

Resolution regarding authorisation for the Board of Directors to decide on acquisition and

sales of own shares (item 16)

The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM authorises the Board of Directors to, at one or more

occasions and up to and including the next Annual General Meeting, resolve to acquire and/or sell

own shares, mainly in accordance with the following terms:

Acquisition may be made with cash payment on Nasdaq Stockholm or in accordance with a tender

offer to all the shareholders. Acquisition of shares may not result in the total holding of own shares, at

any time, exceeding ten (10) percent of all shares in the Company at the time of the AGM's decision

on the authorisation. Acquisition of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only be effected at a price

within the currently effective registered price interval on Nasdaq Stockholm, meaning the price

interval between the highest bid and the lowest ask price. Acquisition in accordance with a tender

offer according to the above shall be effected at a price corresponding to at least the share price at

the time of the offer with a maximum upward divergence of twenty (20) percent.

Sales of shares may take place on or outside Nasdaq Stockholm, with or without deviation from the

shareholders’ preferential rights and with or without payment in kind or payment by way of set-off.

Such sales may be effected at a price within the currently effective registered price interval on

Nasdaq Stockholm, meaning the price interval between the highest bid and the lowest ask price. The

number of shares that may be sold should not amount to more than ten (10) percent of the total

number of shares in the Company. Sales in connection with company acquisitions may be made at a

market value as decided by the Board of Directors.

The purpose of the authorisation above to acquire and sell own shares is to enable financing of

acquisition of operations through payment with own shares and to continuously adapt the Company’s

capital and share structure and thereby contribute to an increase in value for shareholders.

The Board of Directors, the CEO or the person appointed by the Board of Directors may make such

minor adjustments to the resolution of the AGM as are required for its registration with the Swedish

Companies Registration Office or due to other formal requirements.

For a valid decision of the AGM in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal above it is

required that the decision is approved by shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of the

casted votes as well as of the shares represented at the AGM.

Resolution regarding authorisation for the Board of Directors to decide on

new share issue (item 17)

The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM authorises the Board to resolve on issuance of new

shares, at one or more occasions for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting.

Decision pursuant to the authorisation may not result in a new issuance of shares exceeding ten (10)

percent of all shares in the Company at the time of the AGM's decision on the authorisation.

Press Release

Stockholm, Sweden, 21 March 2025

Payment shall be made by cash, payment in kind or by offset. Issues with payment in cash or by set-

off may take place with or without the shareholders’ preferential rights, provided that the issue is

carried out on market terms and conditions.

The reason for the proposal and the possibility of deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights

is to allow flexibility in connection with any acquisitions or capital raising in connection with

acquisitions.

The Board of Directors, the CEO or the person appointed by the Board of Directors may make such

minor adjustments to the resolution of the AGM as are required for its registration with the Swedish

Companies Registration Office or due to other formal requirements.

For a valid decision of the AGM in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal above it is

required that the decision is approved by shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of the

casted votes as well as of the shares represented at the AGM.

Shareholders’ right to request information

Executive Officer shall, if any shareholder so requests and the Board of Directors deems that it can

be made without substantial damage to the Company, at the AGM provide information regarding

may affect the assessment of the Company’s economic situation. The disclosure requirement also

covers information regarding the Company's relationship to another Group company, the consolidated

accounts and such matters regarding subsidiaries as referred to in the preceding sentence.
